## Context

*What is the issue that is motivating this decision or change?*

Across all the pieces of the Palace project stack we need a way to record changes made so that we can include detailed release notes
with each release. These release notes will include references to the pull requests that brough the changes in, or to the ticket that
was created for each code change.

Release notes make it easier for the team to understand what has changed, what has been fixed, and what is a known issue for each software
release. This reduces the duplication of effort required to reproduce bugs and understand problems.

## Decision
